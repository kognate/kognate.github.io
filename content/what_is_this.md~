This is a simple site generator (it's call Pelican) and the whole site is
served up via Github.  Github has a feature that allows users to publish 
a developer site (which this is) and it's free.

While managing a site via Github pages is not as easy as something like
SquareSpace or Wordpress, it's not difficult.  It has the additional advantage
of being easy to manage and is free.
