A big chunk of the current charitypay backend is for handling the
collection and management of partner-provided recipient information.
Most of the functionality there can be replaced with a 
[google form](https://goo.gl/forms/i4rERVIjMQNQoLQ12).  While this
lacks branding, it is functional and reasonably secure.  

## How it would work ##

Each partner organization would have their own form.  They would be
sent a url to the form (like the one above) and be able to enter the
information into the form but they would not need to have access to
the submitted data.  Only you and the people you share the associated
Google Sheet with would have access to the raw data.  This would allow
the auditors to review the information.

Suveys could be handled in a similar manner.
